## Evidence folders

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [releases](releases/) | Dated comparisons and their manifests; use October 25 for current results |
| [runs](runs/) | Sanitized earlier run exports used to reconstruct the comparisons, not private execution logs |
| [archives](archives/) | Superseded presentation snapshots and provenance needed to verify earlier seals |
| [figures](figures/) | Earlier shared figures; current charts are in the October 25 release |

Question, measurement, figure, website and dated seal bytes are unchanged by the
folder cleanup. Existing manifests retain their original logical file names;
the [layout manifest](../scripts/layout_manifest.json) records their physical
locations, and the offline validators apply that mapping explicitly.

For viewing historical HTML, the published [website](../docs/) retains its
original directory structure and URLs. Use the current interactive report for
the latest comparison.
